## üßÆ SQL Queries Used

### üîπ Data Cleaning
```sql
UPDATE coffee_shop_sales
SET transaction_date = STR_TO_DATE(transaction_date, '%d-%m-%Y');

ALTER TABLE coffee_shop_sales
MODIFY COLUMN transaction_date DATE;
```

### üîπ KPI Calculations
```sql
SELECT ROUND(SUM(unit_price * transaction_qty)) AS Total_Sales
FROM coffee_shop_sales
WHERE MONTH(transaction_date) = 5;

SELECT COUNT(transaction_id) AS Total_Orders
FROM coffee_shop_sales
WHERE MONTH(transaction_date) = 5;

SELECT SUM(transaction_qty) AS Total_Quantity_Sold
FROM coffee_shop_sales
WHERE MONTH(transaction_date) = 5;
```

### üîπ Month-over-Month Growth
```sql
SELECT
  MONTH(transaction_date) AS month,
  ROUND(SUM(unit_price * transaction_qty)) AS total_sales,
  (SUM(unit_price * transaction_qty) - LAG(SUM(unit_price * transaction_qty), 1)
   OVER (ORDER BY MONTH(transaction_date))) / LAG(SUM(unit_price * transaction_qty), 1)
   OVER (ORDER BY MONTH(transaction_date)) * 100 AS mom_increase_percentage
FROM coffee_shop_sales
WHERE MONTH(transaction_date) IN (4, 5)
GROUP BY MONTH(transaction_date)
ORDER BY MONTH(transaction_date);
```

### üîπ Daily Sales vs Average
```sql
SELECT
  DAY(transaction_date) AS day_of_month,
  SUM(unit_price * transaction_qty) AS total_sales,
  AVG(SUM(unit_price * transaction_qty)) OVER () AS avg_sales
FROM coffee_shop_sales
WHERE MONTH(transaction_date) = 5
GROUP BY DAY(transaction_date);
```

### üîπ Sales by Day Type
```sql
SELECT
  CASE
    WHEN DAYOFWEEK(transaction_date) IN (1, 7) THEN 'Weekend'
    ELSE 'Weekday'
  END AS day_type,
  ROUND(SUM(unit_price * transaction_qty), 2) AS total_sales
FROM coffee_shop_sales
WHERE MONTH(transaction_date) = 5
GROUP BY day_type;
```

### üîπ Sales by Store Location
```sql
SELECT store_location,
       SUM(unit_price * transaction_qty) AS Total_Sales
FROM coffee_shop_sales
WHERE MONTH(transaction_date) = 5
GROUP BY store_location
ORDER BY Total_Sales DESC;
```
